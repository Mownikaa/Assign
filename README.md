# Requirements:

## Before you start coding, check out the existing code:
1. check index.ts to see how we run the server and create a `users` router
2. check the user routes: get all users and get individual
3. send request queries to get all users and one user by user id

<br>

## TODOs:
`after reading and practicing the existing code do the followings`:
1. continue the user route with tasks:
  * create new user
  * update user information (like name and/or age)
  * delete user
